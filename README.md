# Autoplius ads scrapper

### Implemented tasks:
- [X] URL's gathering from autoplius sitemap
- [X] Defined data fields
- [X] Free proxy usage feature(by default disabled)
- [X] Implemented VIN code decoder and image reader using OCR tools
- [X] Implemented automatic Captcha solver (There is no need to use proxies at this point)

### Tasks to do:
- [] Create virtual environment for easier necessary package installation
- [] Merge new ads links with scrapped url's list
- [] Improve automatic Captcha solver by not hardacoding crop values(if Selenium window is at different size, captcha is not properly cropped)
- [] Make it faster by implementing Asynchronous requests
